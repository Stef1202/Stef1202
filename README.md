# Stefanie Asaytono [Front-end Application Developer]
Front end application developers are computer programmers who specialize in website design. Front end developer duties include determining the structure and design of web pages, striking a balance between functional and aesthetic design, and ensuring web design is optimized for smartphones. A front-end application developer is responsible for implementing visual and interactive elements that users engage with through their web browser when using a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.
